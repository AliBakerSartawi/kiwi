# Kiwi ü•ù

Kiwi is a type-safe key-value in-memory data structure store... maybe even a message broker... maybe even a document database... let's see where we go.

## Commands

Below is a table of Redis and Kiwi. Commands that have a ü•ù after them are Kiwi-specific. These Kiwi-specific commands are provided for type-safety or performance reasons.

Note: Some commands might be moved from **Will Implement** to _Might Implement_, or vice versa.

Let's discuss if Kiwi should be a _superset_ of Redis; providing everything in Redis and more, or if it should be a _subset_ providing only the core or most-used Redis commands, along with Kiwi-specific commands.

If we go the _superset_ route, why not even include the **Redis Stack** modules?

## Type Prefixes

A type prefix is a suggested naming technique for keys to easily communicate the type of a key's value. If you have a key that's called `int-count`, you know you can safely do `INCR` on it, etc etc.

The syntax is `<type>-<key_name>`.

Let's discuss what the delimiter might be, `-` or `:`, or something else. Using `:` would mean that the store is namespaced by type.

Types are:

- str (String)
- int (Integer)
- float (Float)
- bool (Boolean)

Examples:

- ```shell
  SET int-count surprise # this won't work because `surprise` can't be parsed as an integer.
  ```

- ```shell
  SET str-xxx 10 # 10 is set here as a string, not a number.
  INCR str-xxx # This won't work, even if the string value can be parsed as an integer.
  ```

- ```shell
  SET str-a "lorem ipsum"
  RENAME str-a a # This works, because not specifying a type prefix defaults to string.
  RENAME a int-a # This won't work.

  SET int-x 10
  RENAME int-x x # If we decide to allow this, the value `10` must be stringified and treated as a string.
  ```
