## Type Prefixes

A type prefix is a suggested naming technique for keys to easily communicate the type of a key's value. If you have a key that's called `int-count`, you know you can safely do `INCR` on it, etc etc.

The syntax is `<type>-<key_name>`.

Let's discuss what the delimiter might be, `-` or `:`, or something else. Using `:` would mean that the store is namespaced by type.

Types are:

- str (String)
- int (Integer)
- float (Float)
- bool (Boolean)

Examples:

- ```shell
  SET int-count surprise # this won't work because `surprise` can't be parsed as an integer.
  ```

- ```shell
  SET str-xxx 10 # 10 is set here as a string, not a number.
  INCR str-xxx # This won't work, even if the string value can be parsed as an integer.
  ```

- ```shell
  SET str-a "lorem ipsum"
  RENAME str-a a # This works, because not specifying a type prefix defaults to string.
  RENAME a int-a # This won't work.

  SET int-x 10
  RENAME int-x x # If we decide to allow this, the value `10` must be stringified and treated as a string.
  ```
